A heading with the text "My Favorite Movies".
An unordered list of your top five favorite movies, each represented by a list item that includes the movie title, director, and year of release.
A table that displays information about each movie, including the title, director, year of release, and a brief description.
Add a CSS style rule to the table to set the text alignment to center and add a background color to the table header row.
